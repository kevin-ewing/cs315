When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political 
bands which have connected them with another, & to assume among the powers of the earth, the 
separate & equal station, to which the laws of nature & of nature's god entitle them, a decent 
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them 
to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal: that they are endowed 
by their creator with inherent & inalienable rights: that [among] these are life, liberty, & 
the pursuit of happiness: that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, 
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed: that whenever any form of government 
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, & to 
institute new government, laying it's foundation on such principles, & organising it's powers in 
such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. prudence 
indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and 
transient causes: and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to 
suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which 
they are accustomed. but when a long train of abuses & usurpations, begun at a distinguished 
period, & pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute 
despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government & to provide new 
guards for their future security. such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and 
such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge their former systems of government. the 
history of the present king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting injuries & usurpations, 
among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest, but all have in 
direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. to prove this, let facts 
be submitted to a candid world, for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good:

he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate & pressing importance, unless suspended 
in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has neglected 
utterly to attend to them.
