Running and testing the program.
    1. The run.sh script when exicuted will make and run the test by copying 
    the contents from test_files/test_from.txt to test_files/test_to.txt.
    
    2. The test_files/test_to.txt. file contents is then printed on screen to 
    show that the copy has been made.

    3. The script then uses make clear_out to remove test_files/test_to.txt.
